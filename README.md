# HeatingPi
Using a Raspberry Pi to control the central heating

This project uses a Raspberry Pi (original version B) to control my central heating.

It takes into account holidays, vacations, summer time and also school holidays.
These are defined in an external parameter file that needs to be edited manually. Hopefully
I will get around to a more friendly interface in time.

This project is not based on any other. But when I put it on Github and did a search for it,
to make sure it could be found, I found sixty (!) others that matched my search. So another
bit of wheel-reinvention. Well, it was fun.

The hardware setup is described in my blog:
